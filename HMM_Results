Model       Validation Accuracy Comments
Baseline    92.14               This model predicts the most frequent tag for a word, for unknown words it cannot make a prediction.
+ lowercase 90.59               Lowercasing helps reduce the number of unknown words. But it seems to hurt the baseline model. 
HMM         91.43               Basic HMM model.
+ lowercase 90.47               Lowercasing to minimize unknown words, hurts performance same as the baseline model.
+ glove-50  91.55               Replace an unknown word with the most similar know word according to glove-50 model. 
+ glove-100 91.71               Similar to last but with the glove-100 model. Glove models are lowercased, so we used lowercased data for these two.
+ fasttext  91.65               Similar to last but with faststext model.
- lowercase 92.46               So far we searched for known words among the top 10000 similar words. Reducing it to 1000 doesn't help performance but it is a bit faster to run.
+ topn=10k 92.51               Fasttext supports cased words, so removing lowercasing we get a bit better performance, beating the baseline.


Further comments:

The results here are on a validation set which was randomly sampled from the training data. See line 88 of hmm.py.
