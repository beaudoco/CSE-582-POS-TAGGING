PROJECT DUE: March 12th

Things to do:
    1. Hidden Markov Model
    2. Logistic Regression (Sheryll did)
    3. Multi-layer Perceptron
    4. Evaluation Metrics for each model (accuracy, etc.)
    5. Final visuals (plots, confusion matrices)

Dividing up Tasks: (Put your name next to the one you'll do, or propose a new component if you have any ideas)
    -Word2Vec Embeddings (Sheryll)
    -Logistic Regression (Sheryll)
    -HMM
    -Multi-layer Perceptron (Sadia)
    -Visuals (If anyone is really good at making plots, I'd say this could be enough work for someone)
    -If we want to experiment with different word embedding methods (Collin suggested One Hot Encoding)

Timeline:
    By March 1st: Have word embeddings, 3 models written (models not hard since just libraries), and visual functions written. 
        Don't worry about performance/accuracies yet.
    March 1st-8th: Work on testing and improving accuracies, generating final visuals. 
    March 8/9th: Project done, so we can have a couple days to put together a presentation for 13th/15th
        (Sheryll doesn't mind putting a majority of it together, since she's presenting it)
